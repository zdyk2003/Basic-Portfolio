			<div class= "intro">

				<p>My name is Zoe and I am a dental hygienist starting her career in web development.
				</p>
			
				<p>So now you're asking, "How did a dental hygienist become interested in code?" 
				</p>
			
				<p>I have always been interested in technology.  I just didn't know where to start. I like to create things and I am intrigued with how things work behind the scenes.  What happened before the final project was completed? How did the project get to where it is today? These are the things I want to know and be a part of. I know I can make projects that look 100 times better than my blogspot blog did 10 years ago!  
				</p>
			
				<p>What do I like to create?  I like to cook, I have various home improvement and decorating projects going at the same time, and I like organization.</p>
			
				<p>When I'm not creating...I enjoy the outdoors (skiing, hiking and running.) I also enjoy eating out, working out, and cheering my kids on at their various sports.  Oh! I'm also a HUGE fan of my dachshunds George and Axl.
